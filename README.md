**REST API Assignment for retrieving user data**

**Project Overview:**
This project is a basic RESTful API that reads user data from a JSON file specifically users.json file and provides several endpoints for retrieving user information. This project was aimed at implementing a working basic API with routes that fetches all users, user by ID, user by profession and user by name as well as handling errors when certain criteria for user details are not being met such as an unavailable user name from the JSON file.

**Key Features:**
GET/users: Retreives all users from the JSON file dataset.
GET/users/id: Retreives a specific user by their ID.
GET/users/profession: Retreives a specific user by their profession.
GET/users/name: Retreives a specific user by their name.

**What I Learned:**
- How to start an Express server.
- Handling basic errors in Express server.
- Retrieving specific user information by parsing JSON file.
- Uploading project files into Github repository.

**Discussion**

Working on this project really opened my eyes to see the intricacies involved in buiding a basic Express server and creating RESTful APIs with the help of Node.js. This has really piqued my interest in the whole world of RESTful APIs and given me the consideration of diving deeper into more complex APIs and servers to improve my back-end developer experience.
