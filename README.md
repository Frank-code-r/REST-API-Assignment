REST API Assignment for retrieving user data

Project Overview
This project is a basic RESTful API that reads user data from a JSON file specifically users.json file and provides several endpoints for retrieving user information. This project was aimed at implementing a working basic API with routes that fetches all users, user by ID, user by profession and user by name as well as handling errors when certain criteria for user details are not being met such as an unavailable user name from the JSON file.

Key Features
GET/users: Retreives all users from the JSON file dataset.
GET/users/id: Retreives a specific user by their ID.
GET/users/profession: Retreives a specific user by their profession.
GET/users/name: Retreives a specific user by their name.
